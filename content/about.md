Hi! This is Oscar. I am a Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience in some domains and using a few programming languages. I have bachelor´s and master´s degrees in Computer Science, a specialization in Systems Architecture, and a few Java certifications, including a couple ones issued by SUN Microsystems &#128517;.

On this personal blog, I'll post things related to technology, software engineering, systems architecture, and so on. Also, there is a section with some pictures I've been taking.

Few free to reach me on my social networks.
