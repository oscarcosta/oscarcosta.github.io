Here is another post-install tutorial for my current Dell Inspiron 5515 laptop system. This post is an update of the previous "Fedora 38 After Install Guide - 2023 Edition". Therefore, some content may be duplicated. This guide serves as a reminder to myself on what to do after installing Fedora Linux from scratch.

This post includes sections on how to perform **System Update and Configuration**, install **Additional Packages**, **Gnome Extensions**, and **Other Software** that I use daily.

-----

## 1. System Update and Configuration

Update the system using **Gnome Software** or via the terminal using the command `$ sudo dnf update`. It may be necessary to restart the system to update some packages.

If you havenÂ´t enabled the Third Party and RPM Fusion repositories during installation, enable them using **Gnome Software**, or `dnf`

```bash
$ sudo dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories
$ sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
$ sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
$ sudo dnf update
```

### Additional Configs

**Auto-mount second disk**

I have a second encrypted SSD in which I store VM images, home folder backups, and other things. This SSD has to be automatically mounted. To configure the system to auto-mount this second SSD, we need to:

1. Create a folder to serve as the mount point, e.g.: `/mn/data/`.
2. Open the GNOME Disks application.
3. Locate the SSD in the list of drives, and mount it if necessary.
4. Select the encrypted LUKS partition and access its *Encryption Options*.
5. In the Encryption Options dialog, disable the defaults option.
6. Select the decrypted partition and access its *Mount Options* 
7. In the Mount Options dialog, disable the defaults option and make the necessary changes. For example, specify the desired mount point (e.g., /mnt/data/).
8. Take ownership of the drive by configuring the appropriate settings within the GNOME Disks application.

**Scale external display**

My laptop has a 15.6" display with a 1080p resolution, and the default 100% scale works great for me. However, when using an external 2k or 4k display, the default scales of 100% and 200% make things either too small or too big. To solve this issue without lowering the monitor resolution, we need to allow other display scales. To do that, we need to enable the experimental feature "scale-monitor-framebuffer" using **gsettings**.

```bash
$ gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"
```

Alternatively, this change can be made using **dconf Editor**. After applying the feature, it is possible to select scale values like 125%, 150%, 175%, and others in the display settings for each monitor.

## 2. Additional Packages & Applications

Most of the packages listed below are present in the **Gnome Software** application. For those packages that are not available on [**DNF**](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/package-management/DNF/) or [**Flatpak**](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/flatpak/) we need to do a few more tweaks to install.

Moreover, for some of the applications below, I prefer to run them from the user folder. So, I simply download and run them as it is. Some of the applications based on AppImage or Electron automatically install themselves in the current user folder and create application shortcuts or desktop entries.

### 2.1 Gnome Applications

**GNOME Extensions**: You can install GNOME Extensions by searching for "Extensions" in Gnome Software or by using the terminal command: `$ sudo dnf install gnome-extensions`. Alternatively, you can manage Gnome Extensions directly from the website using the browser extension GNOME Shell Integration.

*Reference: https://extensions.gnome.org/*

**GNOME Tweaks**: To install GNOME Tweaks, look for "Tweaks" in Gnome Software or use the terminal command: `$ sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks`.

*Reference: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tweaks*

**Dconf Editor**: You can install Dconf Editor by searching for "Dconf Editor" in Gnome Software or using the command: `$ sudo dnf install dconf-editor`. 

*Reference: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DconfEditor*

**Pomodoro**: To install Pomodoro, use Gnome Software or the terminal command: `$ sudo dnf install gnome-pomodoro`. After installation, the Pomodoro extension will be enabled on the next login.

*Reference: https://gnomepomodoro.org/*

### 2.2 Photo/Image Editing

**Darktable**: Install it via Gnome Sofware.

**GNU Image Manipulation Program (Gimp)**: Install it via Gnome Sofware.

### 2.3 Compression utilities

Install via terminal.

```bash

*Reference: https://itsfoss.com/install-discord-fedora/*

**Slack**: Install it via **Gnome Sofware**.

**Skype**: To install Skype on Fedora, use Gnome Software to install it from Flatpak, or you need to add the Skype repository and then install the Skype package:

```bash
$ sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/skype-stable.repo https://repo.skype.com/rpm/stable/skype-stable.repo
$ sudo dnf install skypeforlinux
```
Alternatively, download the last version of Skype from official repository https://repo.skype.com/rpm/stable/, then install the RPM package using the command `$ sudo dnf localinstall skypeforlinux_<VERSION>.rpm`
