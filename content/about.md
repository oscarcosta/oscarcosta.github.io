Hi! This is Oscar. I'm a Software Developer with 15+ years of experience in some domains and a few programming languages. I have bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science, a specialization in Systems Architecture, and a few Java certifications.

On this personal blog, I'll post things related to technology, software engineering, systems architecture, and so on. Also, there is a section with some pictures I've been taking.

Few free to reach me on my social networks.
